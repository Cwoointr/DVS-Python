However,the memory leak caused by DCProcNativePicture is not now 700bytes. It is less than 30Kbytes but near size.The 68K library (DC120V1543.68K.Lib) is not tested.1999/3/29--------------------------------------------------------Readme -- DC120V1542.PPC.ShLibThe released modules are DC120V1542.PPC.ShLib and DC120.h.The difference between V1541 and V1542 is reducing memory leakinternal of DCProcNativePicture function.V1541 leaks about 30Kbytes when DCProcNativePicture is called at first time. V1542 reduces it to about 700bytes. This remaining700 bytes leak cannot be fixed easily due to the SDK configuration.SDKversion macro in DC120.h is not updated except comment since V154 as V1541 release set does.1999/3/19--------------------------------------------------------Eastman Kodak Japan R&D CenterSoftware Group
