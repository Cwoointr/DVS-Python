Matters to be noted when using DC120SDK in the VB environment (1)  The 32-bit DC120SDK consists of DLL file; which is DC120V??_32.dll.      However, when using the DC120SDK in the VB environment, DC120VBIFLV??_32.dll is also required.      DC120VBIFLV??_32.dll provides interface to use the DC120SDK for application created in the VB      environment.  Although this interface conforms to most functions provided by       the DC120SDK, there exist some unsupported functions and different parameters.      Therefore,please refer to the Sample Application, as well as checking the contents of      DC120ilvb.BAS file, when making a DC120SDK-linked application in VB environment. (2)  When loading DLL with Windows95 or WindowsNT, search directories in the order described       below;      1. The directory from which the application is loaded.       2. The current directory.       3. Windows 95: The Windows system directory. Use the GetSystemDirectory function to get          the path of this directory.         Windows NT: The 32-bit Windows system directory. Use the GetSystemDirectory function          to get the path of this directory. The name of this directory is SYSTEM32.      4. Windows NT only: The 16-bit Windows system directory. There is no Win32 function         that obtains the path of this directory, but it is searched. The name of          this directory is SYSTEM.      5. The Windows directory. Use the GetWindowsDirectory function to get the path of         this directory.       6.The directories that are listed in the PATH environment variable.   You have to confirm the followings when making a DC120SDK-linked application in the VB   environment  -  When reading a project file after starting the VB, two required DLL files should exist      in the directories which match above cases 3 to 6.  -  When starting the VB by double-clicking the project file, the directory which contains     the project file becomes current directory.     Therefore, three required DLL files should exist in the above cases 2 to 6.  -  When distributing an application created in the VB environment, EXE file of such      application is in the above directory 1.  Therefore, it is recommended that you install      three required DLL files in the same directory.
