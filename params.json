Save Our Children's Sight accomplishes it's mission of providing low-income children aged 2-6 the vision they need to succeed in life by identifying, treating, and preventing vision disorders.\r\n\r\n# What We Do\r\n\r\nWe're combining specialized hardware and software to create a digital vision screening system that automatically detects the presence of eye diseases such as amblyopia, strabismus, and cataracts.\r\n\r\n## Technologies\r\n* OpenCV\r\n* PIL\r\n* wxPython\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
